            Response expected: yes. Add a file or directory. This uses any previous Argument, Directory,
            Entry, or Modified requests, if they have been sent. The last Directory sent specifies the
            working directory at the time of the operation. To add a directory, send the directory to be
            added using Directory and Argument requests. For example:
            C: Root /u/cvsroot
            . . .
            C: Argument nsdir
            C: Directory nsdir
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir/nsdir
            C: Directory .
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir
            C: add
            S: M Directory /u/cvsroot/1dir/nsdir added to the repository
            S: ok
            
            You will notice that the server does not signal to the client in any particular way that the
            directory has been successfully added. The client is supposed to just assume that the directory
            has been added and update its records accordingly. Note also that adding a directory is immediate;
            it does not wait until a ci request as files do. To add a file, send the file to be added using a
            Modified request. For example:
            C: Argument nfile
            C: Directory .
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir
            C: Modified nfile
            C: u=rw,g=r,o=r
            C: 6
            C: hello
            C: add
            S: E cvs server: scheduling file `nfile' for addition
            S: Mode u=rw,g=r,o=r
            S: Checked-in ./
            S: /u/cvsroot/1dir/nfile
            S: /nfile/0///
            S: E cvs server: use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently
            S: ok
            
            Note that the file has not been added to the repository; the only effect of a successful add
            request, for a file, is to supply the client with a new entries line containing `0' to indicate an
            added file. In fact, the client probably could perform this operation without contacting the server,
            although using add does cause the server to perform a few more checks. The client sends a subsequent
            ci to actually add the file to the repository. Another quirk of the add request is that with CVS 1.9
            and older, a pathname specified in an Argument request cannot contain `/'. There is no good reason
            for this restriction, and in fact more recent CVS servers don't have it. But the way to interoperate
            with the older servers is to ensure that all Directory requests for add (except those used to
            add directories, as described above), use `.' for local-directory. Specifying another string for
            local-directory may not get an error, but it will get you strange Checked-in responses from the buggy
            servers.

            Tell the server that filenames should be matched in a case-insensitive fashion.
            Note that this is not the primary mechanism for achieving case-insensitivity;
            for the most part the client keeps track of the case which the server wants to use
            and takes care to always use that case regardless of what the user specifies.
            For example the filenames given in Entry and Modified requests for the same file must
            match in case regardless of whether the Case request is sent. The latter mechanism is
            more general (it could also be used for 8.3 filenames, VMS filenames with more than one `.',
            and any other situation in which there is a predictable mapping between filenames in
            the working directory and filenames in the protocol), but there are some situations it
            cannot handle (ignore patterns, or situations where the user specifies a filename and the
            client does not know about that file).

            Tell the server what directory to use. The repository should be a directory
            name from a previous server response. Note that this both gives a default
            for Entry and Modified and also for ci and the other commands; normal usage
            is to send Directory for each directory in which there will be an Entry or
            Modified, and then a final Directory for the original directory, then the
            command. The local-directory is relative to the top level at which the
            command is occurring (i.e. the last Directory which is sent before the
            command); to indicate that top level, `.' should be sent for

            If an Entry request is sent without Modified, Is-modified,

            If both Entry and one of Modified, Is-modified, or Unchanged are sent for the

            Response expected: yes.
            Expand the modules which are specified in the arguments. Returns the data in
            Module-expansion responses. Note that the server can assume that this is checkout or export,
            not rtag or rdiff; the latter do not access the working directory and thus have no need to
            expand modules on the client side. Expand may not be the best word for what this request does.
            It does not necessarily tell you all the files contained in a module, for example.
            Basically it is a way of telling you which working directories the server needs to know about
            in order to handle a checkout of the specified modules. For example, suppose that the server has
            a module defined by aliasmodule -a 1dir
            
            That is, one can check out aliasmodule and it will take 1dir in the repository and check it out
            to 1dir in the working directory. Now suppose the client already has this module checked out and
            is planning on using the co request to update it. Without using expand-modules, the client would
            have two bad choices: it could either send information about all working directories under the
            current directory, which could be unnecessarily slow, or it could be ignorant of the fact that
            aliasmodule stands for 1dir, and neglect to send information for 1dir, which would lead to
            incorrect operation. With expand-modules, the client would first ask for the module to be expanded:
            C: Root /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot
            . . .
            C: Argument aliasmodule
            C: Directory .
            C: /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot
            C: expand-modules
            S: Module-expansion 1dir
            S: ok
            
            and then it knows to check the `1dir' directory and send requests such as Entry and Modified for
            the files in that directory.

                the server only needs to know whether the file is modified, not the 
                contents. The commands which can take Is-modified instead of Modified 
                with no known change in behavior are: admin, diff (if and only if two 
                `-r' or `-D' options are specified), watch-on, watch-off, watch-add, 
                watch-remove, watchers, editors, log, and annotate. For the status 
                command, one can send Is-modified but if the client is using imperfect 
                mechanisms such as timestamps to determine whether to consider a file 
                modified, then the behavior will be different. That is, if one sends 
                Modified, then the server will actually compare the contents of the file 
                sent and the one it derives from to determine whether the file is 
                genuinely modified. But if one sends Is-modified, then the server takes 
                the client's word for it. A similar situation exists for tag, if the `-c' 
                option is specified. Commands for which Modified is necessary are co, ci, 
                update, and import. Commands which do not need to inform the server about 
                a working directory, and thus should not be sending either Modified or 
                Is-modified: rdiff, rtag, history, init, and release. Commands for which 
                further investigation is warranted are: remove, add, and export. Pending 
                such investigation, the more conservative course of action is to stick to 
                Modified.

            This uses any previous Argument, Directory, Entry, or Modified requests, if they have been sent.
            The last Directory sent specifies the working directory at the time of the operation. Note that
            this request does not actually do anything to the repository; the only effect of a successful
            remove request is to supply the client with a new entries line containing `-' to indicate a removed
            file. In fact, the client probably could perform this operation without contacting the server, although
            using remove may cause the server to perform a few more checks. The client sends a subsequent ci request
            to actually record the removal in the repository.

            Note that pathname is a local directory and not a fully qualified

            use the init request, not Root. pathname does not include the hostname
            of the server, how to access the server, etc.; by the time the CVS
            protocol is in use, connection, authentication, etc., are already taken care of.
            The Root request must be sent only once, and it must be sent before any requests
            other than Valid-responses, valid-requests, UseUnchanged, or init.

            the working directory at the time of the operation. No provision is made for any

            Tell the server that the directory most recently specified with Directory
            has a sticky tag or date tagspec. The first character of tagspec is `T' for
            a tag, or `D' for a date. The remainder of tagspec contains the actual tag or
            date. The server should remember Static-directory and Sticky requests for a
            particular directory; the client need not resend them each time it sends a
            Directory request for a given directory. However, the server is not obliged
            to remember them beyond the context of a single command.
