            Additional data: repository \n. Response expected: no.
            Tell the server what directory to use. The repository should be a directory
            name from a previous server response. Note that this both gives a default
            for Entry and Modified and also for ci and the other commands; normal usage
            is to send Directory for each directory in which there will be an Entry or
            Modified, and then a final Directory for the original directory, then the
            command. The local-directory is relative to the top level at which the
            command is occurring (i.e. the last Directory which is sent before the
            command); to indicate that top level, `.' should be sent for
            local-directory.

            Here is an example of where a client gets repository and local-directory.
            Suppose that there is a module defined by moddir 1dir
            
            That is, one can check out moddir and it will take 1dir in the repository
            and check it out to moddir in the working directory. Then an initial
            check out could proceed like this:
            
            C: Root /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot
            . . .
            C: Argument moddir
            C: Directory .
            C: /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot
            C: co
            S: Clear-sticky moddir/
            S: /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot/1dir/
            . . .
            S: ok
            
            In this example the response shown is Clear-sticky, but it could be
            another response instead. Note that it returns two pathnames. The
            first one, `moddir/', indicates the working directory to check out
            into. The second one, ending in `1dir/', indicates the directory to
            pass back to the server in a subsequent Directory request. For example,
            a subsequent update request might look like:
            
            C: Directory moddir
            C: /home/kingdon/zwork/cvsroot/1dir
            . . .
            C: update
            
            For a given local-directory, the repository will be the same
            for each of the responses, so one can use the repository from
            whichever response is most convenient. Typically a client will
            store the repository along with the sources for each local-directory,
            use that same setting whenever operating on that local-directory,
            and not update the setting as long as the local-directory exists.
            A client is free to rename a local-directory at any time (for example,
            in response to an explicit user request). While it is true that the
            server supplies a local-directory to the client, as noted above, this
            is only the default place to put the directory. Of course, the various
             Directory requests for a single command (for example, update or ci
            request) should name a particular directory with the same local-directory.
            Each Directory request specifies a brand-new local-directory and
            repository; that is, local-directory and repository are never relative
            to paths specified in any previous Directory request.
