            Response expected: yes. Add a file or directory. This uses any previous Argument, Directory,
            Entry, or Modified requests, if they have been sent. The last Directory sent specifies the
            working directory at the time of the operation. To add a directory, send the directory to be
            added using Directory and Argument requests. For example:
            C: Root /u/cvsroot
            . . .
            C: Argument nsdir
            C: Directory nsdir
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir/nsdir
            C: Directory .
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir
            C: add
            S: M Directory /u/cvsroot/1dir/nsdir added to the repository
            S: ok
            
            You will notice that the server does not signal to the client in any particular way that the
            directory has been successfully added. The client is supposed to just assume that the directory
            has been added and update its records accordingly. Note also that adding a directory is immediate;
            it does not wait until a ci request as files do. To add a file, send the file to be added using a
            Modified request. For example:
            C: Argument nfile
            C: Directory .
            C: /u/cvsroot/1dir
            C: Modified nfile
            C: u=rw,g=r,o=r
            C: 6
            C: hello
            C: add
            S: E cvs server: scheduling file `nfile' for addition
            S: Mode u=rw,g=r,o=r
            S: Checked-in ./
            S: /u/cvsroot/1dir/nfile
            S: /nfile/0///
            S: E cvs server: use 'cvs commit' to add this file permanently
            S: ok
            
            Note that the file has not been added to the repository; the only effect of a successful add
            request, for a file, is to supply the client with a new entries line containing `0' to indicate an
            added file. In fact, the client probably could perform this operation without contacting the server,
            although using add does cause the server to perform a few more checks. The client sends a subsequent
            ci to actually add the file to the repository. Another quirk of the add request is that with CVS 1.9
            and older, a pathname specified in an Argument request cannot contain `/'. There is no good reason
            for this restriction, and in fact more recent CVS servers don't have it. But the way to interoperate
            with the older servers is to ensure that all Directory requests for add (except those used to
            add directories, as described above), use `.' for local-directory. Specifying another string for
            local-directory may not get an error, but it will get you strange Checked-in responses from the buggy
            servers.
