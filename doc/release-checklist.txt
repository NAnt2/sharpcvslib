Steps to perform in a sf.net release:
-------------------------------------

1) Change the version in the SharpCvsLib.build directory to the target for the release version.
    - eg) currently this is release 0.3.5

2) Run the nant build with no target specified.  This will run the build and execute the unit tests.  
    - If the tests fail then you are not ready for a release.
    NOTE: There are problems with connection timeouts.  

3) Run the nant target dist.  This will perform the following operations:
    - Build the project and tests
    - Copy the project files and the test files to the dist directory
    - Create 2 zip files
        a) ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-src.zip
        b) ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-bin.zip

4) Upload these releases files to sf.net
    a) Change to the (local) directory that the dist has put the zip files in:
        >> cd [base.dir]/dist/[version-number]/

    b) login to the sf.net anonymous ftp:
        >> ftp upload.sourceforge.net

        -- username: anonymous
        -- password: your-email-address@right-here.com

    c) switch the transport type to binary
        >> binary
    
    d) change directory to the incoming folder
        >> cd /incoming

    e) upload the source release
        >> put ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-src.zip

    f) upload the binary release
        >> put ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-bin.zip

    g) terminate the ftp connection
        >> bye

5) Update the file release information and attach the uploaded files to the release.
    - see sf.net to complete this task:

6) Increment the version number appropriately.
