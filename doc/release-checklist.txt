Steps to perform in a sf.net release:
-------------------------------------

1) Change the version in the SharpCvsLib.build directory to the target for the release version.
	- eg) currently this is release 0.3.5

2) Change the version in the AssemblyInfo.cs file located in the directory:
	+ sharpcvslib
		+ src
 			+ ICSharpCode
				+ SharpCvsLib
					- AssemblyInfo.cs **** Change ME!! ****

3) Run the nant build with no target specified.  This will run the build and execute the unit tests.  
	- If the tests fail then you are not ready for a release.
	NOTE: There are problems with connection timeouts.  
		- If you notice that your test runs well sometimes and not another then please test against your 
			local repository.  
		- Better yet if you know a safe way to fix this (by safe I mean not looping through an authorization 
			routine, that could lead to account lockouts) please email me the fix (Re: Bug # 758445).

4) Run the nant target dist.  This will perform the following operations:
	- Build the project and tests
	- Copy the project files and the test files to the dist directory
	- Create 2 zip files
		a) ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-src.zip
		b) ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-bin.zip

5) Upload these releases files to sf.net
	a) Change to the (local) directory that the dist has put the zip files in:
		>> cd [base.dir]/dist/[version-number]/

	b) login to the sf.net anonymous ftp:
		>> ftp upload.sourceforge.net

		-- username: anonymous
		-- password: your-email-address@right-here.com

	c) switch the transport type to binary
		>> binary
	
	d) change directory to the incoming folder
		>> cd /incoming

	e) upload the source release
		>> put ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-src.zip

	f) upload the binary release
		>> put ICSharpCode.SharpCvsLib-[version-number]-bin.zip

	g) terminate the ftp connection
		>> bye

6) Update the file release information and attach the uploaded files to the release.
