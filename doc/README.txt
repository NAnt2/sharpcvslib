.NET CVS Client Library 0.3
http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpCvsLib/
------------------------------------------------

I started this project mainly to give my free gpl'ed IDE SharpDevelop
(Download at http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/) the ability to
communicate with a CVS server. The project now has grown large enough
and I decided to release the CVS part as a libray of its own which can
be used in projects other than my IDE only.

I hope this will be useful and I would like to see that people
use and improve this library.
